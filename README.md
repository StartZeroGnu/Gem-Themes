# gem-themes

Scaffold to build a [Jekyll (3.2.1)](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme as a RubyGem
based on the [official theme "minima 1.2"](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) by
[Parker Moore](https://github.com/parkr).

If you want to know the steps to create or re-use this scaffold, **take a look at the** [**wiki**](https://github.com/StartZeroGnu/gem-themes/wiki)

**I used this files of "minima theme" as an example**

* ["minima.gemspec"](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/minima.gemspec)
* [".gitignore"](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/.gitignore)
* ["Rakefile"](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/Rakefile)
